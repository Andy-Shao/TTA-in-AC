# Comparation Projection
The previous research implements using different datasets and different software environments. 
As a result, it is too difficult to compare their lurking properties, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve. 

This projection is reaching out to find a methodology to compare their attributes and characteristics under the same datasets.
